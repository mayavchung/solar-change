./feedbacks/ folder includes code to estimate radiative feedbacks and generate main text Figure 2 and Supplemental Materials Figure 2. 

Uses radiative kernel from [Soden et al. (2008)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/21/14/2007jcli2110.1.xml) which can be downloaded [here](https://climate.rsmas.miami.edu/data/radiative-kernels/).

These scripts are based on code by Chenggong Wang and further details and original code are available [here](https://github.com/ChenggongWang/Radiative_Response_with_Radiative_Kernel).
